# Tropo_corrections

This repository is hope to extract important parameters Pressure, Temperaure, Water vapor from Numerical Weather model. Later, apply to Machine learning algorithm to predict total delay of a specific area. 

The code will include instruction/script into how to download WM data with RAiDER, GOES, and GNSS stations. 

Currently it's still work in progress. This page will continue to be updated.
